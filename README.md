The [SQLCipher](https://github.com/sqlcipher/sqlcipher) amalgamation as C source for `-sys` crates, on native targets and on `wasm32-unknown-unknown` through [`sqlite-wasm-rs`](https://github.com/Spxg/sqlite-wasm-rs), where it adds the [libtomcrypt](https://github.com/libtom/libtomcrypt) crypto provider.

Native builds compile `SOURCE_FILE` with their own crypto provider and flags:

```rust
let dir = sqlcipher_src::source_dir();
assert!(dir.join(sqlcipher_src::SOURCE_FILE).is_file());
assert!(dir.join(sqlcipher_src::HEADER_FILE).is_file());
```

`sqlite-wasm-rs` 0.6 compiles `WASM_SOURCE_FILE` instead of plain SQLite when `SQLITE_WASM_RS_SOURCE_DIR` points at the same directory, set in the environment or in `[env]` of `.cargo/config.toml`:

```sh
export SQLITE_WASM_RS_SOURCE_DIR="$(cargo metadata --format-version 1 \
  | jq -r '.packages[] | select(.name == "sqlcipher-src") | .manifest_path' \
  | xargs dirname)/sqlcipher"
cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown
```

Shared-memory builds (`+atomics`) also need `-mbulk-memory` in `CFLAGS_wasm32_unknown_unknown`.

The sources are generated from signed SQLCipher and libtomcrypt releases by `upgrade.sh`. CI runs `rusqlite`'s SQLCipher tests on them natively, and checks that files written natively and in Node, Chrome and Firefox open on both sides.

The wrapper is MIT, SQLCipher is BSD-3-Clause, SQLite is public domain, and libtomcrypt is public domain or WTFPL.
